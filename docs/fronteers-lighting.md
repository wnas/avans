Inline scripts, really bad. but in the beginning we didn’t know it was a bad thing, so slowly we started decoupling our code and go from 
— inline
— multiple scripts
— one script tag in the bottom
— to Angular mess

2
Inline styles, we don’t do that any more. We knew that was a bad idea. And we learn from our mistakes, so React…
-img react code

3
accessibility, that was something we didn’t knew and thank god we learned, I mean the mess that was Geocities is no more. luckily we now know better and will for instance never leave out a submit button…
— avans.nl
or a label…

Usability is not a feature

4
overcomplicated code. that is something which is bad for maintenance, performance and more. So this is a thing of the past, right?

Simple is better, most of the times…

Flash. that was then, we sure as hell won’t put our trust in the fact that everybody had a certain technique and that it won’t ever change, right

13
platforms
be platform agnostic. make sure the design works everywhere. That means, not making and iPhone button for android users or putting roboto everywhere.

14
input mediums

get real users to test with screenreaders and more…

20
div and span
please use more elements, there are so much elements we don’t appreciate enough.
using them is a good way to appear really smart and maybe it also helps your user . think input type number or proper usage of footer, header, aside and article elements.
gotta catch ‘m all.

21
Use CSS more often. don’t start with javascript for everything
